# Fetch - Website

This website created using Django framework allows users to register and create a new profile with all their details.
Just like how browsers auto fills your information when registering to new websites or entering login information, Fetch allows you
to auto complete most of your details using any browser.

This works by using an API which the user uses to login to places using Fetch, just like 'Login with Facebook' or 'Login with Google'.
